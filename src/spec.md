# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update navigation menu styling to green tones, reposition About page in navigation order, and extend map coverage to all countries worldwide.

**Planned changes:**
- Change Navigation component color scheme from current colors to green tones using the forest palette
- Reorder routes in App.tsx so About page appears immediately after Home page
- Extend PollutionMap component to include all countries with pollution data and interactive SVG paths

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a green-themed navigation menu, find the About page positioned right after Home in the navigation, and interact with a complete world map showing pollution data for all countries.
